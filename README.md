# Worship Room

## Project Overview
Worship Room is a web application designed for live streaming worship services. It aims to provide an easy-to-use platform for broadcasting worship sessions, allowing users to connect and participate from anywhere.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies for the entire application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/worship-room.git
   cd worship-room
   ```

2. Install all dependencies (both client and server) by running:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start the application in development mode using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start both the client and server concurrently. 

- The client will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- The server will run in the background managing API requests.

## Features
- **Live Streaming:** Stream worship services live to participants.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive web interface for users to interact with the live stream.
- **Concurrent Operations:** Uses the `concurrently` package to run the client and server simultaneously during development.

- **concurrently:** Allows running multiple commands concurrently, which is essential for starting both the client and server at the same time.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "concurrently": "^8.2.0"
